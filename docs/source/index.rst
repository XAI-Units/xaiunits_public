XAI-Units
=======================================

This is a library to help benchmark and compare explainable AI feature attribution methods. It contains a collection of datasets and models with specific units of behaviour that are known to be challenging for feature attribution methods. The library also contains an end-to-end pipeline for applying feature attribution methods across a range of datasets/models, scoring them with metrics, then summarising the results.
